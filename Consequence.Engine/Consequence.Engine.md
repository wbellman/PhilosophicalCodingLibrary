# Consequence.Engine
_"You can press the button. You will be rewarded. But someone else will suffer... comically."_

## Concept
Inspired by the Twilight Zone and Buridan’s Ass, this service offers a configured number users a button to press for a small gain—at the cost of triggering a silly or surreal consequence for another user. The twist: one of the pushers becomes the next potential victim.
The chained consequence demonstrates the Twilight Zone plot-line while the need for consensus mirrors the decision paralysis of the thought experiment: "Buridan's Ass".

## Features
- Reward/punishment loop with consequence delay
- Public consequence system
- Guilt dashboard & button history logs
- User mutation (e.g., name changes, badge swaps, avatar jokes)
- "Victim of the Button" achievements

## Tech Stack Ideas
- ORM: ASP.NET Core with EF Core
- SQL based data solution
- SignalR or WebSockets for live feedback
- Optional message queue for delayed effects

## Nearly Practical Techniques
- Event-based flow control
- Ethical logic simulation
- Dynamic user metadata and profile mutation
- Social-engineering inspired architecture
