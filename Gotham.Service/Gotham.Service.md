# Gotham Service
_"Not the answer you need. The answer you deserve."_

## Concept
A judgmental API that returns not what the client asked for, but what it decides the client *deserves*. Inspired by The Dark Knight and Plato's Cave, this service interprets input and returns symbolic, tangential, or moralistic responses using a rules engine or LLM.

## Features
- AI or rules-based response evaluation
- Literal vs symbolic vs poetic outputs
- Input-based karma scoring
- Optional "cave depth" settings (proximity to truth)
- Markdown or JSON formatted responses

## Tech Stack
- ASP.NET Core / Minimal API
- OpenAI or local LLM integration
- SignalR for live output updates
- Markdown rendering
- Response scoring middleware

## Nearly Practical Techniques
- Input interpretation
- LLM integration
- Content shaping and customization
- Humorous but deep output variation
