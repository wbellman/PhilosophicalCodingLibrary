# Heidegger’s Dasein Monitor
_"To be marked present, one must first affirm their existence."_

## Concept
A presence system that doesn’t track whether you're online—but whether that user exists. Inspired by Heidegger's notion of Dasein ("existence"), users must affirm their own existence via posting introspective content earn a 24-hour "I exist" brain icon.
Evaluation will be "behind the scenes" by the monitor system itself.

## Features
- Existential heartbeat prompts ("Why are you online?")
- Time-limited presence validation
- Reflective prompt engine (rules or LLM-based)
- Leaderboard of Most Present Users
- Optional badge + status system

## Tech Stack Ideas
- ASP.NET Core + SignalR or WebSockets
- Identity & token tracking
- Scheduled background jobs to expire presence
- Optional LLM prompt evaluation (OpenAI or local)

## Nearly Practical Techniques
- Soft identity and presence modeling
- AI-judged user input
- Philosophical framing of static output
- Meaningful badge systems outside of typical auth
