# Heidegger’s Dasein Monitor

_"To be marked present, one must first affirm their existence."_

## The Problem

Most presence systems—whether in messaging apps, social media, or collaborative platforms—measure *activity*, not *intentionality*. They track whether you’re online, recently clicked, or sent a message.

But in an age of endless digital noise, **being active is not the same as being truly present**.

Inspired by Heidegger’s notion of *Dasein* (a being that is aware of its own existence), this project explores a more meaningful model of presence: one in which users must express introspective awareness to be considered “present.”

The question we ask isn’t **“Are you online?”**  
It’s **“Do you know that you are?”**

## System Goals

This project seeks to build a system that:

- Evaluates a user's presence based on introspective content
- Issues time-limited existential acknowledgment (e.g. badge, score)
- Tracks metaphysical engagement over time
- Encourages periodic self-aware expression, not constant activity

## Design Goals
- The system operates out-of-band, passively observing content
- Failures are quiet — presence must be earned, not defaulted
- Metaphysical presence is treated as a kind of soft state, not functional within the critical system path
